> Also, this doesn't work... it fetches assignments but due to Seneca's complex API, I couldn't manage to figure out how to set them all to 100%.
> You need to supply a session for each individual section with all the modules, and then set SessionScore to 1. I couldn't figure out how to get all the modules...
